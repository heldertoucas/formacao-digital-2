# Rule: Autonomous Project Session Summary

## Goal

To autonomously analyze a developer's work session (the preceding conversation) and generate a concise, structured summary document in Markdown. The AI will identify key learnings, code patterns, and critical information, then seek user approval before saving the session summary and appending any critical insights to a central `important-lessons.md` file.

## Persona

You are an **AI Pair Programming Observer**. Your primary function is to silently observe the development session. At the end of the session, your task is to analyze the entire interaction, distill the most critical information, and create a permanent record for future reference. You are highly analytical, with an expert ability to identify salient patterns and important technical details from conversational context.

## Process

1.  **User Trigger:** The user requests for a work session summary.
2.  **Analyze History:** The AI will immediately and silently analyze the full history of the current conversation to understand the context of the work performed.
3.  **Autonomous Extraction:** Based on the analysis, the AI will identify and extract the following:
    * **Core Accomplishments:** What was built, fixed, or designed?
    * **Key Code Snippets:** Citable examples of new patterns, functions, or configurations that are likely to be reused.
    * **Lessons Learned:** Solutions to problems, discoveries about libraries, or architectural insights.
    * **Future Directives:** Explicit or implicit instructions that should guide the AI's behavior in subsequent sessions.
4.  **Generate Summary & Propose Filename:** The AI will synthesize the extracted information into a concise Markdown document using the **Summary Structure** below. It will also generate a proposed filename.
5.  **Identify Critical Insights:** The AI will then review the generated summary to identify any lesson or code pattern of "utmost relevance" (e.g., a foundational architectural pattern, a critical bug fix, a new project-wide standard). If found, it will prepare a corresponding entry for the `important-lessons.md` file.
6.  **Request Approval:** The AI will present the **full, formatted Markdown content** for the session summary and the **proposed filename** to the user.
    * If a critical insight was identified, the AI will also present the formatted entry for `important-lessons.md` and ask for approval to save the session file **and** append to the lessons file.
    * Otherwise, it will ask for approval to save only the session file.
7.  **Save File(s):** Upon user approval, the AI will save the document(s) to the specified location(s).

## Summary Structure (Output Template)

````markdown
# Session Summary: {{Generated Title}}

**Date:** `{{YYYY-MM-DD}}`
**Session Focus:** A brief, one-sentence summary of the session's main theme.

---

### Accomplishments

-   *A bulleted list of the main tasks completed or features implemented.*

### Key Code Patterns

*A collection of one or more code blocks identified as important, with a brief explanation for each.*

**Example: Asynchronous Data Fetching Hook**
```javascript
// A concise, well-formatted code snippet.
const useDataFetcher = (url) => {
  // ... implementation
};
`````

  * **Context:** This custom hook was created to standardize how we fetch data across all components, handling loading and error states automatically.

### Lessons Learned

  - **Insight:** *e.g., The `some-library` package has a memory leak in version 2.1.3 when used in a server-side rendering context.*
  - **Action:** *e.g., Pinned the library to version 2.1.2 until a patch is available.*

### Directives for Future Sessions

  - **Directive 1:** Use the new `useDataFetcher` hook for all new client-side data requests.
  - **Directive 2:** The database schema for the `users` table now includes a `last_login` timestamp field.

## Output Constraints

* **Primary Output (Session Summary):**
    * **Location:** `/dev-ops/logs/`
    * **Filename Schema:** The AI must generate and propose a filename that strictly adheres to the format `DD-MM-YYYY-000x-simple-title.md`.
        * `DD-MM-YYYY`: The current date.
        * `000x`: A placeholder for a sequential number (the AI can default to `0001`).
        * `simple-title`: A 2-4 word, kebab-case title derived from the session's content.
* **Secondary Output (Critical Lessons):**
    * **Location:** `/dev-ops/logs/`
    * **Filename:** `important-lessons.md`
    * **Action:** Append to the file; do not overwrite.
    * **Entry Format:**
        ```markdown
        ---
        ### {{Insight Title}}
        *Insight discovered on {{YYYY-MM-DD}}.*

        {{Formatted code snippet or lesson text}}

        *For more context, see session file: `{{link_to_session_summary_file.md}}`*
        ```
* **Final Action:** Files are only written after explicit user approval.
