# PRD: Refactor and Rename Application Header Component

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a code refactoring task. The goal is to rename the primary application header component from its temporary name, `AppHeaderV2`, to a more descriptive and permanent name, `GlobalHeader`. This change is intended to improve the clarity, readability, and long-term maintainability of the codebase.

## 2. Goals

*   **Improve Code Clarity:** Replace a temporary, versioned component name with a clear, descriptive name that accurately reflects its function.
*   **Enhance Maintainability:** Make it easier for current and future developers to understand the purpose of the component, reducing onboarding time and the risk of errors.
*   **Increase Consistency:** Align the component's name with best practices for naming shared, site-wide components.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a developer, I want** components to have clear and descriptive names, **so that** I can understand the structure of the codebase more quickly.
*   **As a new developer joining the project, I want** the codebase to be as self-documenting as possible, **so that** I can onboard faster and contribute with confidence.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The file `components/layout/AppHeaderV2.tsx` must be renamed to `components/layout/GlobalHeader.tsx`.
2.  The React component defined within the file must be renamed from `AppHeaderV2` to `GlobalHeader`.
3.  All page components that currently import and render `AppHeaderV2` must be updated to import and render the new `GlobalHeader` component.
4.  The props and functionality of the header component must remain identical after the renaming.
5.  The old `AppHeaderV2.tsx` file must be deleted from the project after all references have been updated.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   This task **will not** change the `Header.tsx` component, which is used on the main `HomePage.tsx`. The main page's top navigation bar will remain unchanged.
*   No functional or visual changes will be made to the header component itself. This is strictly a refactoring of its name.

## 6. Design Considerations

*   None. This is a code refactoring task with no visual impact.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   The change will require updating import paths in multiple page components.
*   Care must be taken to ensure that the component's props (`title`) are correctly passed in all instances after the rename.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   The application must build successfully without any errors after the changes are applied.
*   A code review of the changes confirms that all instances of `AppHeaderV2` (both in imports and JSX) have been replaced with `GlobalHeader`.
*   The old file, `components/layout/AppHeaderV2.tsx`, no longer exists in the codebase.

## 9. Open Questions

*   None.
