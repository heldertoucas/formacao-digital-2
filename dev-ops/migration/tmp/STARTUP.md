### \#\# Guide: Lean Stack Setup with Next.js & Mantine

This guide will walk you through creating and configuring a new, production-ready Next.js project with the Mantine UI library.

-----

### **Phase 1: Environment & Repository Setup**

This phase prepares your Cloud Shell and creates the GitHub repository.

**Step 1.1: Install & Authenticate the GitHub CLI**
This tool allows us to manage GitHub repositories from the terminal.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh -y
gh auth login
```

  * Follow the on-screen prompts, choosing `GitHub.com`, `HTTPS`, and `Login with a web browser`.

**Step 1.2: Create and Clone the GitHub Repository**
This command creates the repository on GitHub and clones it to your Cloud Shell.

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Replace <repo-name> with your desired repository name
gh repo create <repo-name> --public --clone --description="Digital Literacy Portugal Portal (Next.js + Mantine)"
```

**Step 1.3: Navigate into Your Project**

```bash
# Replace <repo-name> with the name you chose above
cd <repo-name>
```

-----

### **Phase 2: Scaffolding the Next.js Project**

This phase uses the official Next.js tool to create a modern, production-ready application.

**Step 2.1: Scaffold the Next.js App**
This command will create a new Next.js project in your current directory.

```bash
pnpm create next-app@latest .
```

  * You will be asked a series of questions. Use these answers for a clean, professional setup:

    ```
    âœ” Would you like to use TypeScript? â€¦ **Yes**
    âœ” Would you like to use ESLint? â€¦ **Yes**
    âœ” Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? â€¦ **Yes**
    âœ” Would you like to use the `src/` directory? â€¦ **Yes**
    âœ” Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) â€¦ **Yes**
    âœ” Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? â€¦ **No**
    ```

**Step 2.2: Make the First Commit**
This saves the initial project structure to your repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial scaffold with create-next-app"

# Preemptive Fix: This ensures your branch is named 'main'
# (Run this command only if your default branch was created as 'master')
git branch -m master main

git push -u origin main
```

-----

### **Phase 3: Integrating Mantine UI**

Now, we will add the Mantine component library.

**Step 3.1: Install Mantine Dependencies**
This command installs all the necessary Mantine packages.

```bash
pnpm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks postcss-preset-mantine
```

**Step 3.2: Configure PostCSS**
Mantine requires a simple PostCSS configuration. **Create a file named `postcss.config.cjs`** in the root of your project with this content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-preset-mantine': {},
    'tailwindcss/nesting': {},
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

**Step 3.3: Configure the Mantine Provider**
To use Mantine components, we need to wrap our application in a provider. Open your root layout file at `src/app/layout.tsx` and modify it as follows:

```typescript
// Import MantineProvider and the CSS file
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';
import '@mantine/core/styles.css';

import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import "./globals.css";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        {/* Wrap your children with the MantineProvider */}
        <MantineProvider>{children}</MantineProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

-----

### **Phase 4: Establishing the Internal Project Structure**

Finally, let's create the logical folders to organize our three programs.

**Step 4.1: Create Program Routes**
Create a folder for each of our three programs inside the `src/app/` directory.

```bash
mkdir -p src/app/passaporte src/app/futuro src/app/ia
```

**Step 4.2: Create Component Folders**
Create a structured home for our reusable components.

```bash
mkdir -p src/components/common src/components/layout src/components/passaporte src/components/futuro src/components/ia
```

**Step 4.3: Create a `lib` Folder**
Create a place for shared hooks, utilities, and other non-visual code.

```bash
mkdir src/lib
```

**Step 4.4: Commit the New Structure**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: integrate mantine and establish project structure"
git push
```

**Setup Complete\!** ðŸš€ You now have a clean, powerful, and lean Next.js project with Mantine UI, ready for development.
