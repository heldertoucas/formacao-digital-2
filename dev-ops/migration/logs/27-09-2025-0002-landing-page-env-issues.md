# Session Summary: Landing Page Content and Environment Issues

**Date:** `2025-09-27`
**Session Focus:** To implement the static content sections of the main landing page and diagnose a recurring environment setup issue that prevented pre-commit verification.

---

### Accomplishments

-   **Landing Page Content:** Successfully implemented all static content sections (Hero, About, Testimonials, Contact) on the main landing page (`apps/portal/src/app/page.tsx`) as defined in `prd-0001-prd-portal-landing-page.md`.
-   **Component Refactor:** Refactored the shared `Card` component (`packages/ui/src/atoms/Card/Card.tsx`) to be more flexible, adding a `bodyClassName` prop to allow for custom styling of the content area.

### Key Code Patterns

**Refactored Card Component**
```typescript
// packages/ui/src/atoms/Card/Card.tsx
import React from 'react';

export interface CardProps {
  title?: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
  bodyClassName?: string;
}

export const Card = ({ title, children, className, bodyClassName }: CardProps) => {
  const baseClasses = 'card bg-base-100 shadow-xl';
  const combinedClassName = [baseClasses, className].filter(Boolean).join(' ');
  const bodyClasses = ['card-body', bodyClassName].filter(Boolean).join(' ');

  return (
    <div className={combinedClassName}>
      <div className={bodyClasses}>
        {title && <h2 className="card-title">{title}</h2>}
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
- **Context:** The `Card` component was updated to support a `bodyClassName` prop. This was necessary to apply centering styles (`items-center text-center`) directly to the card's body for the Hero and Testimonial sections, making the component more reusable.

### Lessons Learned

- **Insight:** The development environment is missing its `node_modules` dependencies. This prevents critical verification scripts (e.g., `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check-types`) from running, as commands like `pnpm` and `turbo` are not found.
- **Action:** The standard workflow was paused before the commit step. The immediate cause is an incomplete environment setup. The resolution, as per project documentation, is to run `pnpm install`.

### Directives for Future Sessions

- **Directive 1:** The project's dependencies **must** be installed with `pnpm install` before attempting to run any verification, build, or development scripts. This will be the first step in resolving the recurring error.
- **Directive 2:** The static content for the landing page is complete. The next task in the plan is `4.0 Implement Page Interactivity`.
