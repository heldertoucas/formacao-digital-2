# Session Summary: Task List Generation and Project Organization

**Date:** `2025-09-27`
**Session Focus:** To transform a high-level development plan into a concrete, actionable task list and reorganize project directories to align with our development operations structure.

---

### Accomplishments

-   **Task List Generation:** Analyzed the roadmap in `dev-ops/tmp/plan1.md` and converted its first phase into a detailed, multi-level task list located at `dev-ops/tasks/tasks-phase-1-ui-kit.md`.
-   **Project Reorganization:** Moved the `tasks/` directory into the `dev-ops/` directory to centralize operational documents.
-   **Documentation Update:** Updated the AI instruction files (`create-prd.md`, `generate-tasks.md`) to reflect the new location of the `tasks` directory, ensuring future work remains consistent.

### Key Code Patterns

**Structured Task List Format**
The following format was established for breaking down development phases into actionable tasks. This will be the standard for all future task lists.

```markdown
## Relevant Files

- `packages/ui/src/organisms/SiteHeader/SiteHeader.tsx` - The main component file for the site header.
- `packages/ui/src/organisms/SiteHeader/SiteHeader.stories.tsx` - The Storybook file for developing and testing the `SiteHeader`.
- ...

### Notes

- All new components will be created within the `packages/ui` directory...
- ...

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Create the `SiteHeader` Organism
  - [ ] 1.1 Create the directory `packages/ui/src/organisms/SiteHeader`.
  - [ ] 1.2 Create the component file `SiteHeader.tsx`...
  - ...
- [ ] 2.0 Create the `SiteFooter` Organism
  - ...
```

- **Context:** This structure, saved in `dev-ops/tasks/tasks-phase-1-ui-kit.md`, provides a clear, hierarchical view of the work required for our Foundational UI Kit, including relevant files and sub-tasks for each major component.

### Lessons Learned

-   **Insight:** A simple file system reorganization (like moving a directory) has cascading effects. It's critical to immediately update all related documentation and instruction files to prevent configuration drift and ensure operational consistency.
-   **Action:** After moving the `tasks` directory, we immediately identified and updated all file paths in the `dev-ops/ai-dev-tasks/` instruction set.

### Directives for Future Sessions

-   **Directive 1:** The task list at `dev-ops/tasks/tasks-phase-1-ui-kit.md` is the active plan for the next phase of development. We will proceed with implementing these tasks sequentially.
-   **Directive 2:** All future PRDs and task lists are to be stored in the `dev-ops/tasks/` directory, as per the updated instructions.
