# Session Summary: Fix Cloud Shell Startup Script

**Date:** `2025-09-28`
**Session Focus:** Debugging and fixing a `customize_environment.sh` script in Google Cloud Shell that failed because `npm` was not available in the startup PATH.

---

### Accomplishments

-   Identified that the `customize_environment.sh` script failed during startup due to an `npm: command not found` error.
-   Diagnosed the root cause: the script executes before the standard shell environment sources `nvm` (Node Version Manager).
-   Corrected the script to manually source `nvm` before attempting to use `npm`.
-   Moved the corrected script to the appropriate `~/.customize_environment` location and made it executable.

### Key Code Patterns

**Corrected `customize_environment.sh` for Google Cloud Shell**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script is run automatically by Google Cloud Shell on startup.
# It ensures that essential development tools are available.

exec > /home/heldertoucas_ie/formacao-digital/dev-ops/logs/startup-script.log 2>&1
echo "--- Script started at $(date) ---"

# Source NVM to make node and npm available
echo "Sourcing NVM..."
if [ -s "/usr/share/nvm/nvm.sh" ]; then
  . "/usr/share/nvm/nvm.sh"
elif [ -s "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh" ]; then
  . "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"
else
  echo "NVM script not found. Cannot proceed."
  exit 1
fi

echo "NVM sourced successfully."

echo "Checking for pnpm..."
if ! command -v pnpm &> /dev/null
then
    echo "pnpm not found. Installing now..."
    # Now that NVM is sourced, npm should be available.
    if command -v npm &> /dev/null; then
      npm install -g pnpm
      echo "pnpm installed successfully."
    else
      echo "Error: npm command not found even after sourcing NVM."
    fi
else
    echo "pnpm is already installed."
fi

echo "--- Script finished at $(date) ---"
```
*   **Context:** This script now reliably installs global node packages during Cloud Shell startup by ensuring `nvm` is loaded first. This pattern is crucial for automating environment setup.

### Lessons Learned

-   **Insight:** The `~/.customize_environment` script in Google Cloud Shell runs in an environment where `nvm` has not yet been sourced.
-   **Action:** Any commands that rely on Node.js or `npm` within this script must be preceded by manually sourcing the `nvm.sh` script (e.g., `. /usr/share/nvm/nvm.sh`).

### Directives for Future Sessions

-   None.
