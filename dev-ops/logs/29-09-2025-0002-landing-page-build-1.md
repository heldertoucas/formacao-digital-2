# Session Summary: Landing Page Implementation - Phase 1

**Date:** `2025-09-29`
**Session Focus:** To execute the first three parent tasks of the landing page PRD, including creating foundational components and building the hero, about, testimonials, and contact sections.

---

### Accomplishments

-   Began execution of the task list for the landing page (`tasks-0001-prd-portal-landing-page.md`).
-   **Task 1.0 Complete:** Created all foundational components: `SiteHeader`, `SiteFooter`, and a reusable `Card`. Integrated the header and footer into the root layout using Mantine's `AppShell`.
-   **Task 2.0 Complete:** Implemented the main Hero section, adapting a user-provided visual inspiration into a two-column layout with a headline and illustration, followed by the three program cards.
-   **Task 3.0 Complete:** Built and integrated the "About," "Testimonials," and "Contact" static content sections, completing the main content of the landing page.
-   **Bug Fixes:** Diagnosed and fixed two runtime errors: one `Module not found` error by installing `@tabler/icons-react`, and a React `Element type is invalid` error by refactoring the `MantineProvider` into a proper client component.

### Key Code Patterns

**1. Reusable Card Component**

A flexible `Card` component was created to be used for both programs and testimonials. It uses a `Stack` with `justify="space-between"` to ensure actions align at the bottom, regardless of content height.

```typescript
// src/components/common/Card.tsx
export function Card({ title, children, actions, className }: CardProps) {
  return (
    <MantineCard shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder className={className} h="100%">
        <Stack justify="space-between" h="100%">
            <Stack>
                {title && (
                    <Title order={4}>{title}</Title>
                )}
                {children}
            </Stack>

            {actions && (
                <Group justify="flex-end" mt="md">
                    {actions}
                </Group>
            )}
      </Stack>
    </MantineCard>
  );
}
```
* **Context:** This component serves as a foundational block for content presentation across the site.

**2. Section-based Page Composition**

The landing page (`page.tsx`) was built by creating and composing dedicated components for each major section (`Hero`, `About`, `Testimonials`, `Contact`).

```typescript
// src/app/page.tsx
// ... imports
import { TestimonialsSection } from '@/components/landing/TestimonialsSection';
import { ContactSection } from '@/components/landing/ContactSection';

// ... other section components

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <Container>
      {/* ... Hero and Program Cards ... */}
      <AboutSection />
      <TestimonialsSection />
      <ContactSection />
    </Container>
  );
}
```
* **Context:** This pattern keeps the main page file clean and delegates the implementation details of each section to its own component.

### Lessons Learned

-   **Mantine Compound Components:** When using a bundler like Turbopack, compound components (e.g., `AppShell.Main`) may not resolve correctly. The fix is to use a direct named import (e.g., `import { AppShell, AppShellMain } from '@mantine/core'`).
-   **Icon Libraries:** When using icons in components, ensure the icon library package (e.g., `@tabler/icons-react`) is explicitly installed as a dependency.

### Directives for Future Sessions

-   Continue executing the task list, starting with Parent Task 4.0: "Implement Page Interactivity and Routing".
