# Session Summary: Unrecoverable Browser Tool Failure

**Date:** `2025-10-04`
**Session Focus:** To diagnose and resolve a persistent "Browser is already running" and "Not connected" error with the internal browser automation tooling.

---

### Problem Description

The browser automation tool has entered an unrecoverable state. Initial attempts to use the tool resulted in a "The browser is already running" error. Subsequent troubleshooting steps led to a persistent "Not connected" error, rendering all browser-related tasks impossible.

### Troubleshooting Steps Taken

A comprehensive series of troubleshooting steps were taken to resolve the issue, none of which were successful:

1.  **Process Termination:** Identified and terminated all running `chrome-devtools-mcp` processes using `kill -9`. This resulted in the error changing from "Browser is already running" to "Not connected".
2.  **Profile Deletion:** Removed the browser tool's profile directory at `/home/heldertoucas_ie/.cache/chrome-devtools-mcp/chrome-profile` to force the creation of a fresh profile. The "Not connected" error persisted.
3.  **NPX Cache Clearing:** Cleared the `npx` cache at `/home/heldertoucas_ie/.npm/_npx` to force a fresh download of the `chrome-devtools-mcp` tool. The "Not connected" error persisted.
4.  **Isolated Mode:** Manually started the `chrome-devtools-mcp` tool with the `--isolated` flag, as suggested by the initial error message. The "Not connected" error persisted.
5.  **Environment Verification:** Confirmed that `google-chrome` is correctly installed in the environment via the startup script, as verified by the `startup-script.log` and by running `google-chrome --version`.

### Conclusion

The root cause of this issue appears to be a fundamental problem within the browser automation tool or its interaction with the specific Cloud Shell environment. The failure is not due to a simple stale process or corrupted profile. All documented and logical recovery methods have failed.

### Directives for Future Sessions

-   **Immediate:** All browser-related tasks are blocked. Do not attempt to use the browser tooling until this underlying issue is resolved.
-   **Recommendation:** This summary should be used to report the issue to the appropriate support channel for the browser automation tool.
