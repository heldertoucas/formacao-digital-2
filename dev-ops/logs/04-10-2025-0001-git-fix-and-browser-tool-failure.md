# Session Summary: Git History Fix and Browser Tool Failure

**Date:** `2025-10-04`
**Session Focus:** To resolve a critical Git push failure by rewriting repository history, and to continue landing page development, which was ultimately blocked by an unrecoverable browser tool error.

---

### Accomplishments

-   **Git History Rewritten:** Successfully removed a large `.deb` file from the entire Git history using `git filter-branch`, resolving the `GH001` large file error that was preventing pushes to the remote repository.
-   **404 Page Created:** Created a new, professionally styled 404 "Not Found" page at `src/app/not-found.tsx` using Mantine components, completing sub-task 4.3.
-   **Task List Updated:** Marked the 404-page creation task as complete in the project task list.
-   **Tool Failure Diagnosed:** Confirmed that the internal browser automation tooling enters an unrecoverable state if its processes are manually terminated, leading to a persistent `Not connected` error.

### Key Code Patterns

**1. Forceful Git History Cleaning**

To completely remove a large, unwanted file from all previous commits, the `git filter-branch` command was used. This is a powerful but necessary tool for correcting push rejections due to file size limits.

```bash
# This command rewrites history on all branches to remove the specified file.
git filter-branch --force --index-filter '''git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb''' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# A force push is then required to update the remote.
git push origin main --force
```
* **Context:** This pattern was essential to fix a repository state that was blocking all pushes to GitHub.

**2. User-Friendly 404 Page**

A simple, centered 404 page was created using a Mantine `Card` and `Container` to provide a clear and helpful user experience for invalid routes.

```typescript
// src/app/not-found.tsx
import { Card, Title, Text, Button, Container, Group } from '@mantine/core';
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function NotFound() {
  return (
    <Container py="xl">
      <Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder>
        <Group justify="center">
          <Title order={1}>404</Title>
        </Group>
        <Text c="dimmed" size="lg" ta="center" mt="md">
          Oops! The page you are looking for does not exist.
        </Text>
        <Group justify="center" mt="xl">
          <Button component={Link} href="/" variant="outline">
            Go back to Home
          </Button>
        </Group>
      </Card>
    </Container>
  );
}
```
* **Context:** This fulfills task 4.3 and establishes a consistent error page style.

### Lessons Learned

-   **Insight:** The browser automation tooling is sensitive to process termination. Manually killing its `chrome` processes (e.g., via `kill -9`) puts the tool into a `Not connected` state from which it cannot recover within the same session.
-   **Action:** This confirms the lesson from a previous session: the only reliable way to fix a locked browser tool is to restart the entire Cloud Shell session. Attempting to manually clean up processes is ineffective.

### Directives for Future Sessions

-   The immediate next action is to perform the browser-based testing for task 4.2 (verifying all links on the landing page).
-   The session **must** be restarted before attempting this, to ensure the browser tooling is in a clean state.
