# Session Summary: Component Porting - Foundational Setup

**Date:** `2025-10-05`
**Session Focus:** To formalize the plan for porting the `iapt4` component library into a PRD and task list, and to execute the foundational setup and backend integration tasks.

---

### Accomplishments

-   **Planning Formalized:** Created a detailed Product Requirements Document (`0004-prd-component-library-port.md`) and a corresponding step-by-step task list (`tasks-0004-prd-component-library-port.md`) to guide the component migration.
-   **Foundational Scaffolding Complete (Task 1.0):**
    -   Established the new directory structure at `src/components/ia-ported/`.
    -   Successfully ported the `<RemixIcon />` component and all utility hooks (`useAnimatedSection`, `useCountUp`, `useFloatingEmoji`).
    -   Integrated the Remix Icon font library into the main application layout.
-   **Backend Integration Initiated (Task 2.0):**
    -   Created the `src/services/` directory.
    -   Ported and adapted all data-fetching hooks (`useManifestoData`, etc.) and API services (`supabaseClient`, `manifestoApi`, etc.).
    -   Crucially, refactored the API key handling logic in `apiConfig.ts` to be compatible with the Next.js environment.

### Key Code Patterns

**Adapting Environment Variable Access from Vite to Next.js**

When porting services from a Vite project to a Next.js project, environment variable access must be updated. Vite uses `import.meta.env.VITE_...`, while Next.js exposes client-side variables via `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_...`.

```typescript
// src/services/apiConfig.ts - Adapted for Next.js

export function getApiKey(serviceName: ServiceName): string {
    // ...
    // The key name must be prefixed for client-side access in Next.js
    const nextKeyName = `NEXT_PUBLIC_${baseKeyName}`;
    
    // Access the variable via process.env
    const nextKey = process.env[nextKeyName];
    
    if (nextKey) {
        return nextKey;
    }
    // ... fallback logic
}
```
*   **Context:** This adaptation was critical for ensuring that the ported data-fetching hooks and API services could correctly access the necessary credentials (e.g., for Supabase and Google Gemini) in the new Next.js environment.

### Lessons Learned

-   **Insight:** Migrating components between JavaScript frameworks requires more than just copying files. A key point of failure is the environment-specific way that API keys and other variables are accessed.
-   **Action:** We identified the difference between Vite's `import.meta.env` and Next.js's `process.env` and proactively adapted the `apiConfig.ts` service, preventing future runtime errors.

### Directives for Future Sessions

-   The immediate next step is to complete Task 2.0 by installing the required npm packages (`@supabase/supabase-js`, `@google/genai`) and creating the `.env.example` file to document the project's required secrets.
