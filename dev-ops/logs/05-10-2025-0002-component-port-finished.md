# Session Summary: Component Library Porting and Adaptation

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Session Focus:** To port and adapt the entire component library from the "IA para Todos" (`iapt4`) project to the `formacao-digital-2` project, refactoring them from Tailwind CSS to Mantine UI.

---

### Accomplishments

-   **Project Dependencies:** Installed `@mantine/carousel` and verified that all other required packages (`@supabase/supabase-js`, `@google/genai`) were already present.
-   **Environment Setup:** Created a `.env.example` file to document the necessary environment variables for connecting to Supabase and AI services.
-   **Core UI Components Adapted:** Successfully ported and refactored all core UI components, including `Button`, `Card`, `Accordion`, `TabbedContent`, `QuoteBlock`, and `Carousel`, to use Mantine components and props.
-   **Layout Components Adapted:** Ported layout components like `PageSection` and `LearningUnitLayout` to use Mantine's grid and container system.
-   **E-learning Components Adapted:** Adapted interactive components like `MissionBlock`, `InlineQuiz`, and `SentenceBuilder` to the new Mantine-based design system.
-   **Showcase Components Adapted:** Ported a full suite of showcase components, including `StatsGroup`, `ProgressCard`, and `FeatureGridSection`, refactoring them to use Mantine.
-   **Full Applications Ported:** Adapted the complex, multi-component applications for the "Prompt Factory" and "Manifesto Co-Creation" pages, ensuring their state management and child components were correctly integrated.
-   **Verification Page Created:** Built a comprehensive showcase page at `src/app/dev/ia-ported/page.tsx` that renders every single ported component, serving as a complete visual library and test bed.
-   **Integration:** Replaced the `AboutSection` and `ContactSection` on the main `page.tsx` with the newly ported `AboutV1_Storyteller` and `Footer` components.

### Key Code Patterns

**1. Adapting a Custom Component to Mantine**

The core pattern of this session was to take a component originally styled with Tailwind CSS and refactor it to use Mantine's component system. This involved replacing `div`s and `className`s with corresponding Mantine components and props.

*Original `Button.tsx` (Tailwind):*
```typescript
const variantClasses = {
  primary: 'bg-pcd-accent text-white hover:bg-opacity-90',
  // ...
};
return <button className={`... ${variantClasses[variant]}`}>{children}</button>;
```

*Adapted `Button.tsx` (Mantine):*
```typescript
import { Button as MantineButton } from '@mantine/core';
import Link from 'next/link';

const variantMap = {
  primary: 'filled',
  secondary: 'default',
  ghost: 'subtle',
};

const Button = ({ variant = 'primary', href, ...props }) => {
  const mantineVariant = variantMap[variant];
  if (href) {
    return <MantineButton component={Link} href={href} variant={mantineVariant} {...props} />;
  }
  return <MantineButton variant={mantineVariant} {...props} />;
};
```
*   **Context:** This pattern was applied to dozens of components, systematically replacing a utility-class-based approach with a more robust, prop-based component API, while also integrating Next.js features like the `<Link>` component.

### Lessons Learned

-   **Insight:** A systematic, one-by-one approach to component porting is highly effective. By adapting simple "atomic" components first (like `Button` and `Card`), they can be immediately reused to build more complex composite components, accelerating the overall process.
-   **Action:** The migration was structured to build from the bottom up, ensuring that by the time complex application components like `PromptFactoryApp` were adapted, their constituent UI parts were already available in their new Mantine-based form.

### Directives for Future Sessions

-   The ported component library is now available for use across the `formacao-digital-2` project. Future development should leverage these new components from `src/components/ia-ported/` to build new features and pages.
-   The next logical step is to begin integrating these components into the main application pages, replacing older or less functional equivalents where appropriate.
