# Session Summary: Project Setup and Documentation Migration

**Date:** `2025-09-29`
**Session Focus:** A comprehensive session to set up a new Next.js project, migrate and adapt all project documentation, and resolve multiple environment and tooling issues.

---

### Accomplishments

-   Initialized a new Next.js project using Mantine and Tailwind CSS.
-   Systematically adapted all documentation (Onboarding, Architecture, Workflows, Tooling, Policies) from a monorepo structure to the current single Next.js application architecture.
-   Diagnosed and resolved a `pnpm` build script warning by creating a `.pnpmfile.cjs`.
-   Diagnosed and resolved a React hydration error caused by a browser extension.
-   Implemented a scalable, multi-theme architecture for Mantine and applied a professional "indigo" theme.
-   Created a "Component Library" page at `/dev/components` as a lightweight Storybook alternative.
-   Diagnosed and fixed a server/client component issue by creating a `providers.tsx` wrapper for the `MantineProvider`.
-   Installed and automated the installation of `pnpm` and headless Chrome in the Cloud Shell environment via a `~/.customize_environment` script.

### Key Code Patterns

**1. Mantine Provider for Next.js App Router**

To correctly use Mantine's context-based providers and theme extension APIs, they must be wrapped in a dedicated client component.

```typescript
// src/app/providers.tsx
'use client';

import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';
import { indigoTheme, indigoCssVariableResolver } from '@/themes';
import '@/themes/indigo/style.css';
import '@mantine/core/styles.css';

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={indigoTheme} cssVariablesResolver={indigoCssVariableResolver}>
      {children}
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```
* **Context:** This pattern prevents runtime errors by ensuring client-side APIs are not executed on the server, which is a common issue in the Next.js App Router.

**2. Robust `pnpm` Build Script Approval**

When `pnpm` blocks build scripts for security reasons, the most reliable method to grant permission is using a `.pnpmfile.cjs` hook.

```javascript
// .pnpmfile.cjs
function readPackage(pkg) {
  if (pkg.name === '@tailwindcss/oxide' || pkg.name === 'sharp') {
    pkg.requiresBuild = true;
  }
  return pkg;
}

module.exports = {
  hooks: {
    readPackage
  }
};
```
* **Context:** This approach proved more reliable than editing `package.json` and programmatically enables build scripts for specific, trusted packages.

**3. Cloud Shell Startup Automation**

The `~/.customize_environment` script ensures the development environment is consistent across ephemeral sessions by installing necessary global tools.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ... (logging and nvm sourcing) ...

echo "Checking for pnpm..."
if ! command -v pnpm &> /dev/null
# ... (pnpm installation logic) ...
fi

echo "Checking for Google Chrome..."
if ! command -v google-chrome &> /dev/null
# ... (chrome installation logic) ...
fi

echo "--- Script finished at $(date) ---"
```
* **Context:** This script automates the installation of `pnpm` and `google-chrome`, solving issues related to the ephemeral nature of globally installed packages in Cloud Shell.

### Lessons Learned

-   **Initial Setup:** `npx create-next-app` was used as a workaround for a `uv_cwd` error encountered with `pnpm create`.
-   **Browser Tools:** My internal browser automation tools require Google Chrome to be explicitly installed in the environment and can get into a locked state from stale processes, requiring a session restart.
-   **React Hydration:** Hydration errors can be caused by browser extensions. Testing in incognito mode is the fastest way to confirm this.
-   **CLI Arguments:** The correct syntax for passing port flags to our `pnpm dev` script is `pnpm run dev -p 8080`, not `pnpm run dev -- -p 8080`.

### Directives for Future Sessions

-   The development server should be run on port **8080**.
-   New reusable components should be visualized on the **Component Library** page (`/dev/components`).
-   Themes should be organized in the `src/themes/` directory and are considered interchangeable.
-   "Mini-apps" have a dedicated home at `src/components/mini-apps/`.
